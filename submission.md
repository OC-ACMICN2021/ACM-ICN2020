## Submission and Publication Compliance Policies

Papers submitted for consideration must not have been already published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere during the consideration period. Specifically, authors are required to adhere to the [ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism](http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy) and the [ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions](http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/sim_submissions).

Like other conferences and journals, ICN prohibits violation of the above ACM Policies and may take action against authors who violate them. In some cases, the program committee may share information about submitted papers with other conference chairs and journal editors to ensure the compliance of papers under consideration. If the TPC discovers a violation of these principles, sanctions may include, but are not limited to, contacting the institutions of the authors and publicizing the details of the case.

ICN will review extended versions of previously-published short preliminary papers (such as workshop papers) in accordance with published [ACM SIGCOMM](http://www.sigcomm.org/about/policies/frequently-asked-questions-faq/) policies. Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement requests will not be considered.

Papers must be written in English. All submitted papers will be judged based on their quality and relevance through a single-blind reviewing process. Authors must identify themselves by name and affiliation in the title of the paper.

Submissions can be made through HotCRP: please go to the ICN 2020 Submission Site at [https://icn20.hotcrp.com/](https://icn20.hotcrp.com/).

## Conflicts of interest

Both authors and TPC members must identify conflicts of interest according to the following general principles.

A program committee member (including the chairs of the committee) is considered to have a conflict of interest on a submission that has an author in any of the following categories: the person himself or herself; a past or current student or academic advisor; a supervisor or employee in the same line of authority within the past four years; a member of the same organization (e.g., company, university, government agency, etc.) within the past four years or in the near future (six months); a co-author of a paper appearing in publication within the past four years; someone with whom there has been a financial relationship (e.g., grants, contracts, consultancies, equity investments, stock options, etc.) within the past four years; someone with whom acceptance or rejection would further the personal goals of the reviewer (e.g., a competitor); a member of the same family or anyone considered a close personal friend; or someone about whom, for whatever reason, their work cannot be evaluated objectively. If there is no basis for the TPC conflicts provided by authors, however, those conflicts will be removed. Do not improperly indicate conflicts simply to prevent some TPC members from reviewing your paper.

## Formatting Requirements

The conference solicits both full and short papers. Submissions will be reviewed through a double-blind process, and evaluated on the basis of intellectual merit, originality, importance of contribution to the field, soundness and strength of evaluation (for full papers), quality and clarity of presentation, and appropriate comparison to related work.

Full papers may be up to 10 pages in length, excluding references, following the [ACM SIGCOMM format](https://github.com/conference-websites/acmart-sigproc-template/) (10pt font, `sigconf` option for `acmart` style), and should convey the results of mature research. Short papers may be up to 6 pages in length, excluding references.

Short papers should illustrate important challenges or promising new lines of research in the realm of ICN, either through the presentation of illuminating early research results or through the vehicle of a well-reasoned and thought-provoking position statement. Short papers will be evaluated primarily on their ability to contribute to the future evolution of ICN research in light of the goals described above.
