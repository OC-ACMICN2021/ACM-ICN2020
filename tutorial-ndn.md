### Introduction

With its built-in security and ad hoc mobility support, Named Data Networking (NDN) offers an ideal substrate to meet the needs of emerging new applications, and NDN trials should meet the least resistance at edges. This tutorial is to share our recent progress on new API and plug-n-play support which address the following two obstacles in experimentation with NDN:

- Limited high-level APIs to explore new application ideas, forcing users to work with low level Interest-Data exchange and reimplement basic mechanics (e.g., reliable data fetching); and

- Complexity in deploying NDN applications in local NDN environments, be it an NDN island connected to the NDN testbed, small-scale local NDN testbed, or an ad hoc NDN environment.

The new API is built by combining the results from existing work, which have been published in recent ICN conferences, namely consumer/producer API, Common Name Library (CNL), and pub-sub support. The plug-n-play support is based on our deepened understanding about the relations between NDN configuration and reachability, and the tools to make the former a turn-key solution and the latter automated.

In this tutorial we start with a quick overview of NDN development, followed by a combination of pilot application and the API library descriptions, and wrap up with NDN plug-n-play discussions and demonstrations.

### Tutorial Description

This short tutorial is expected to run 3 hours including a 20-minute break. It will be mostly real-time presentations with a few pieces of recorded demonstrations.

While NDN brings the concept of fetching data using names via Interest/Data packet exchange at the network level, application developers do not need to directly work with such low-level details. Over the last few years, several application/developer-friendly high-level APIs have been proposed that hide data fetching specifics while providing NDN security and other functionality such as multi-party synchronization. In particular, developers can use consumer/producer API support and publish-subscribe concepts to leverage NDN mechanics without directly dealing with individual Interest and Data packets. Moreover, given the major focus on naming in NDN, the team developed an approach to structure application development around the name strucureâ€”NDN Common Name Library (CNL). With CNL, an application can explore available (discoverable) namespaces, subscribe to a namespace branch (i.e., subscribe to a topic) as well as publish data. Therefore, one goal of this tutorial is to introduce high-level concepts such as pub-sub and CNL API that developers can use to write NDN applications. We note that the consumer/producer API work, complements the CNL API by providing data transport services beneath the namespace.
