## Welcome to 7th Annual ACM ICN 2020 Conference!

While our hearts will be in our host city of Montreal, the conference will be held virtually (online) at the same dates from September 29 to October 1, 2020.
Despite this year's challenges and the added burdens on all of us, thanks to the authors, the reviewers and the organizing committee, the program of the conference is as exciting as ever and covers a wide range of novel applications, technologies, architectures, and protocols highlighting the latest information centric networking development.

[The program](program.html) comprises top-quality content demonstrating the scope of ICN research with fifteen (15) papers, six (6) posters and two (2) demos.
Three (3) tutorials will introduce ICN topics.
The program also features an engaging keynote speech delivered by Bruce Maggs (Emerald Innovations/Duke) and is complemented by a panel of experts on Information-Centric Economic, Societal and Governance which is essential to the adoption of ICN.

ICN 2020 was only possible thanks to the great efforts of the organizing and technical committees and the valuable contribution of the authors.
We greatly thank them, and we also thank our supporters and corporate sponsors.
We are confident that we built once again a top-quality program and are looking forward to an exciting conference experience using the best-of-class interactivity tools.

Enjoy the conference! We are looking forward to seeing you in the virtual Montreal online at the end of the month!

## Welcome to ACM ICN 2020

The organizing committee is delighted to invite you to submit your work for presentation at the 7th ACM conference on Information Centric Networking (ICN 2020).
<span style="color: red">Considering challenges we face due to COVID-19 pandemic, the conference will be held in the virtual format on September 29, 2020 - October 1, 2020.</span>
Additional details will be posted as soon as possible.

ACM ICN 2020 is a single-track conference focusing on significant research contributions to ICN as broadly defined, and featuring paper presentations, posters, and demonstrations.

ICN deals with all aspects of an information- or data-centric approach toward supporting networked applications.  Such an approach treats digital objects (i.e., collections of bits) as first-class objects, and supports identification, creation, retrieval, authentication, and access control for such objects through a global service.
