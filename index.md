## Welcome to ACM ICN 2020

The organizing committee is delighted to invite you to submit your work for presentation at the 7th ACM conference on Information Centric Networking (ICN 2020).
<span style="color: red">Considering challenges we face due to COVID-19 pandemic, the conference will be held in the virtual format.</span>
Additional details will be posted as soon as possible.

ACM ICN 2020 is a single-track conference focusing on significant research contributions to ICN as broadly defined, and featuring paper presentations, posters, and demonstrations.

ICN deals with all aspects of an information- or data-centric approach toward supporting networked applications.  Such an approach treats digital objects (i.e., collections of bits) as first-class objects, and supports identification, creation, retrieval, authentication, and access control for such objects through a global service.
