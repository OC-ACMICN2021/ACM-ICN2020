## Instructions to presenters on video preparation

ICN2020 will not recommend a specific video capture tool but the following is expected. 

**Video Resolution**

The preferred resolution is 1080p/HD if possible but 720P is also acceptable. Do not submit 4K content.

**Picture in picture**

The presentation should show slide contents in the main area, with the presenter video in a smaller window (either picture-in-picture or other equivalent composition). Use head/shoulder composition for the presentation rather than larger view areas. Transitions from slides to speaker and back are acceptable when appropriate.

**Background**

Use a plain static background for the presenter, either the speakerâ€™s normal office setting, a solid color, or a static virtual background if a green screen is available. Do not use virtual backgrounds without a green screen, nor animated backgrounds due to the video artifacts that can be introduced.

**Clothing**

Plain clothing in solid color (no prints, logos, graphics etc.) tend to give better quality results. 

**Videos in slide shows**

Do not include videos or fast-moving animations in the slide show material. If video are required please send it separately and will be shown after the slide presentation.l

**Language/images**

Please use care to not not to have any stereotypical or potentially offensive wording, images, or animations. These will be flagged during review and videos will have to be redone.

**Subtitles**

As the videos will be uploaded to the ACM YouTube Channel there is no need to worry about subtitles.
