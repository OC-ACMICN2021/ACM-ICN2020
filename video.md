As you know, ACM ICN2020 will be a virtual conference and the presenters of each paper are asked to prerecord their presentation.
In the following you will find more details about the submission deadline, the requested video file format, name and length, and the video upload procedure.

### Video Submission Deadline

**September 18, 2020**

### Video Length and Format

- The duration of your video depends on the presentation type:

    - Full Paper: **20 min**
    - Short Paper: **12 min**
    - Poster Pitch: **5 min**
    - Demo: **10 min**

    The presentation will be followed by a live discussion slot of 10 minutes for all papers.
    _<u>Please note that the presenter must be present during the online presentation and the discussion slot.</u>_

- **Tool:** ACM ICN 2020 will not recommend a specific video capture tool. Presenters can use various video conferencing tools or dedicated video recording software.  The following is expected from the videos:

- **Video Resolution**:  The preferred resolution is 1080p/HD if possible but 720P is also acceptable.  We do not require a specific bitrate, but we expect videos be of good quality (3000-10,000kb/s rate is good).  Depending on the software you are using to record/edit the video, file size can vary, 200 MB - 2 GB per 20 minute presentation is good.

- **Presenter's headshot:** The presentation should show slide contents in the main area, with the presenter video in a smaller window (either picture-in-picture or other equivalent composition). Use head/shoulder composition for the presentation rather than larger view areas. Transitions from slides to speaker and back are acceptable when appropriate.

- **Background:** Use a plain static background for the presenter, either the speakerâ€™s normal office setting, a solid color, or a static virtual background if a green screen is available. Do not use virtual backgrounds without a green screen, nor animated backgrounds due to the video artifacts that can be introduced.

- **Clothing:** Plain clothing in solid color (no prints, logos, graphics etc.) tend to give better quality results.

- **Videos in slide shows:** Do not include videos or fast-moving animations in the slide show material. If video are required please send it separately and will be shown after the slide presentation.

- **Language/images:** Please use care to not not to have any stereotypical or potentially offensive wording, images, or animations. These will be flagged during review and videos will have to be redone.

- **Subtitles:** As the videos will be uploaded to the ACM YouTube Channel there is no need to worry about subtitles.

### Video and Slides Uploading

- **Video:** Before uploading your video file, please name it using the following naming convention:

    **`{SID}-{presentation-order}-{presenter-last-name}.mp4`**

    where

    - **`{SID}`** is your session ID (you can look for it in the program in the website)
    - **`{presentation-order}`** is the order of your presentation in the session.
    - **`{presenter-last-name}`** is the last name of the presenter.

    For instance, if you are the second (2) presenter in the third (3) session, the name of your file would be: `4-3-PresenterLastName.mp4`.

    For demos the **`{SID}`** would be **"`D`"** and for poster **`{SID}`** should be **"`P`"**, e.g., `D-15-LastName.mp4` and `P-42-LastName.mp4`.

    To get session ID and presentation order, check the [conference program](program.html).

- **Slides:** The presentation slides file should be in PDF format using a similar naming convention:

    **`{SID}-{presentation-order}-{presenter-last-name}.pdf`**

- Once your **video** and **presentation slides** files are ready, please use the link that you have received by the chairs to upload **both files**.  If you have not received the link, contact [Mohamed Faten Zhani](mailto:mfzhani@etsmtl.ca).

**<u>Videos with unacceptable video and audio quality and that do not comply with the above requirements will not be accepted.</u>**

If you have any question, please contact [Mohamed Faten Zhani](mailto:mfzhani@etsmtl.ca) and/or conference chairs.
