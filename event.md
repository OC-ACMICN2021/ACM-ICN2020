Our virtual conference will rely on two platforms:

- **Zoom** videoconferencing for all presentations
- **Slack** for real-time interactions during the conference

Note that you will need both tools at the same time, especially if you are a presenter.
During each session, the designated personnel will play out prerecorded videos, while the presenter must be present in Zoom and Slack to answer questions (any time in Slack in test format, verbally in Zoom after the video).

If you are registered to the conference, you should receive detailed instructions on how to access these tools by email by Monday September 28, 2020.
If you haven't received, please contact the [Registration Chair](mailto:icn202x@gmail.com) as soon as possible.

If you are a presenter, a session chair, a keynote speaker or a tutorial organizer, please make sure to access Zoom and Slack **10 minutes** prior the start of your session.
