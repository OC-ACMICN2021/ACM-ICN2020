The organizing committee is delighted to invite you to submit your work for presentation at the 7th ACM conference on Information Centric Networking (ICN 2020), to be held in **Montreal, Canada, September 28-30, 2020**.

ACM ICN 2020 is a single-track conference focusing on significant research contributions to ICN as broadly defined, and featuring paper presentations, posters, and demonstrations.

ICN deals with all aspects of an information- or data-centric approach toward supporting networked applications.  Such an approach treats digital objects (i.e., collections of bits) as first-class objects, and supports identification, creation, retrieval, authentication, and access control for such objects through a global service.

ACM ICN 2020 solicits research contributions across the full spectrum of technologies and architectures related to ICN, including work that advances core ICN concepts, architectures, technologies, and capabilities; extends current ICN concepts to new networking environments and use cases; realizes, demonstrates, and quantifies the benefits of ICN in traditional and emerging application domains; and catalyzes, incentivizes, simplifies, and supports ICN deployments in realistic, operational environments and settings.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Development, refinement, and extension of existing ICN architectures;
- Design and implementation of global and local information-centric approaches, including named-data, publish-subscribe, and distribution-oriented systems
- Global routing, forwarding, and caching for information-centric networks
- Feature advancement of ICN including policing, QoS, multimedia transport, and adaptive network functions
- ICN implementation approaches based on software-defined networking (SDN), network function virtualization (NFV), or other emerging technologies
- Experiences with application of information-centric networking and computation in various domains such as Internet-of-things, personal communications, public content distribution/exchange, etc.
- Information-centric networking as an approach in mobile or constrained environments including 5G and network slicing, vehicular networking, autonomous driving, and machine-to-machine communication
- Information-centric solutions for integrating big data platforms and machine learning frameworks
- AI/ML techniques to support ICN networks management
- Approaches to coexistence/evolution of information-centric and host-centric networking, including IP-based protocols in support of information-centric operations
- Virtualization, operation, and orchestration of named network resources including forwarding, storage, computation, and the distributed Web
- Platforms allowing specification of computations on data, and orchestration of such computations, including named computing functions at the network edge
- Software design and architectures to support ICN including testing and verification
- Information-centric network management including zero-conf bootstrapping  
- Measurement and analysis of protocols, applications, and infrastructure for distribution of named content
- Security services including confidentiality and access control, authentication, and non-repudiation, as well as infrastructure resilience
- Privacy of consumers and producers of content objects
- Namespace management approaches, case studies, and empirical evaluation campaigns 
- Incentives, money flow, and other sociotechnical aspects of information-centric networking.

## Submission Details

The conference solicits both full and short papers. Submissions will be reviewed through a double-blind process, and evaluated on the basis of intellectual merit, originality, importance of contribution to the field, soundness and strength of evaluation (for full papers), quality and clarity of presentation, and appropriate comparison to related work.

Full papers may be up to 10 pages in length, excluding references, following the [ACM SIGCOMM format](https://github.com/conference-websites/acmart-sigproc-template/) (10pt font, `sigconf` option for `acmart` style), and should convey the results of mature research. Short papers may be up to 6 pages in length, excluding references.

Short papers should illustrate important challenges or promising new lines of research in the realm of ICN, either through the presentation of illuminating early research results or through the vehicle of a well-reasoned and thought-provoking position statement. Short papers will be evaluated primarily on their ability to contribute to the future evolution of ICN research in light of the goals described above.
