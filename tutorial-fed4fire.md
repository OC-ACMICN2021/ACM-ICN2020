### Overview

[Fed4FIRE](https://www.fed4fire.eu) is the largest federation of testbeds in Europe and has also a federation with US GENI (instageni and exogeni testbeds) and US Cloudlab.
With a single Fed4FIRE account and the [jFed tool](https://jfed.ilabt.imec.be) you can access all those resources. The testbeds come in different flavors, such as: wired networking/SDN/NFV testbeds; wireless networking testbeds; 5G testbeds; IoT testbeds; cloud and bigdata testbeds.

The Fed4FIRE EU project has been building on this federation of testbeds since 2012.
The jFed tool has been built by imec/UGent and allows to access all these testbeds from a single tool and with [a single account](https://portal.fed4fire.eu).
The tutorial will show the audience how this works and will of course also allow hands-on following by the audience during the tutorial. The tutorial will include an introduction to Information Centric Networking experimentation on these testbeds.
